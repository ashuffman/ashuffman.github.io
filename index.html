        Hi! I'm Bob!

      <a href="gallery.html">Here are some photos of me that my humans took</a>
      <p>I rescued my humans in January when they came to the Oregon Humane society. I could tell right away that they needed me. So, even thought I <strong>hate</strong> being confined, I braved the carrier and the car ride to my new home.</p>
      <p>My humans have done a great job of creating a comfortable home for me, though, sometimes they don't listen very well. I'm still working on training them. It can be frustrating, but they try so hard. </p>
