          Hi! I'm Bob!
        </h2>
        <img class='intro-photo' src='photos/intro-photo.jpg'/>
        <p>I rescued my humans in January when they came to the Oregon Humane society. I could tell right away that they needed me. So, even though I <strong>hate</strong> being confined, I braved the carrier and the car ride to my new home.</p>
        <p>My humans have done a great job of creating a comfortable home for me, though,  I'm still working on training them. </p>
        <p>You can take a look at some photos of me in the Gallery</p>
        <p>Or, you can see some more information about me, my likes and dislikes on the about page</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by, and happy browsing!</p>
